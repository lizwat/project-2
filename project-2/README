Had To edit receiver.py to read from one call of recv() instead of in loop, since whole message can be sent in one of size 
4096
The final message is printed to the screen, but for some reason f.write() does not write the value to download, but I can see
that the message is correct because it prints?
for some reason, START ACK never makes it to sender, so I had to edit out the code block that waits for start ack
Hence, it currently breaks if start message is lost, but if start message is sent it works as it should

call with 

  python3 receiver.py 1024 2 &
  
  (in new window)
  
  python3 sender.py 127.0.0.1 1024 2 &
